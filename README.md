# Tailwind CSS Playground

A simple starter project for playing around with Tailwind in a proper PostCSS environment.

To get started:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rareyman/tailwindcss-starter.git

   cd tailwindcss-starter
   ```
(Optional: Rename project.)

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # Using Yarn
   yarn
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm run serve

   # Using Yarn
   yarn serve
   ```

   Now you should be able to see the project running at localhost:8080.

4. Open `public/index.html` in your editor and start experimenting!
